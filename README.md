### Build
Android need to build with --no-shrink if else JSCH Fails

### There are better ways to do it
I know I didn't write the best code or use the best method 
(For instance accessing the iut should use a dynamic proxy not doing remote command execution with a python script)

#### Pure android?
I've started developing this app in android studio a non-working(lack of updates) version is available [here](https://github.com/TurtleForGaming/DemoArenaMobile)
